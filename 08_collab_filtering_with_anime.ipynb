        "# Building a collaborative filtering system with anime\n",
        "The ur-example for collaborative filtering is the MovieLens Database, but let's be honest: movie suggestions are nice, but I don't like watching similar movies. For me, media needs to be acclaimed but not to pop, and have a certain degree of cult following. Thus, I'm going to build here a collaborative filtering data set with anime the website My Anime List. I found a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews) on Kaggle with reviews. I downloaded the files and then uploaded them into my personal Google Drive."

If you were to actually build the model, what the Dataloader would do is supply the indices so you don't have to handle any of the backend yourself."
